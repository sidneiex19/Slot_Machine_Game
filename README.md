# Slot Machine Simulator

## Overview
This project is a simple yet engaging slot machine simulator written in Python. It's designed to mimic the basic functionalities of a real-world slot machine, offering users a virtual experience of betting and gambling. This simulator includes features such as user deposits, betting lines, bet amounts, and a straightforward win/lose mechanism.

## Features
- **User Deposits**: Users can deposit an amount within a specified range to start playing.
- **Betting Lines and Amounts**: Players choose the number of lines to bet on and specify their bet amount for each line.
- **Slot Machine Simulation**: The core feature where a 3x3 slot machine is simulated with each column and row populated by random symbols.
- **Win/Lose Outcome**: Each round of play results in a simple win or lose outcome, with the balance updated accordingly.
- **Continuous Play**: Players have the option to continue playing until they decide to quit or their balance is insufficient.
- **Professional Display**: The slot machine's output is displayed professionally, with a special emphasis on the middle row, emulating the appearance of a traditional slot machine.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Deposit an amount to play.
3. Choose the number of lines to bet on.
4. Set your bet amount per line.
5. Play a round and see the outcome.
6. Choose to play another round or quit.

## Technology
This simulator is implemented in Python and is a console-based application. It makes use of basic Python data structures, control structures, and the `random` library for symbol selection.

## Purpose
The project serves as a fun and educational tool for understanding the basics of a slot machine game, Python programming, and simple gambling concepts. It is ideal for beginners looking to apply their Python skills in a project-based learning approach.
